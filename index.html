						<h2>Unreal's Game "Manager"</h2>
						<h5>GameMode</h5>
					</section>
					<section>
						NOTE: With 4.14, the GameMode Class got split into GameModeBase and GameMode.
						GameModeBase has less features, because some games just might not need the full feature list
						of the old GameMode Class.
						The class AGameMode is used to define the RULES of your game. This includes
						the used classes, like APawn, APlayerController, APlayerState and more.
						It is only available on the Server. Clients don't have an object of the GameMode
						and will only get a nullptr when trying to retrieve it.
					</section>
				</section>

					<section>
						<h2> Game State </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						NOTE: With 4.14, the GameState Class got split into GameStateBase and GameState.
						GameStateBase has less features, because some games just might not need the full feature list
						of the old GameState Class.
						The class AGameState is probably the most important class for shared information
						between Server and Clients. The GameState is used to keep track of the current State of the Game.
						This includes, for Multiplayer important, a List of connected Players (APlayerState).
						The GameState is replicated to all Clients. So everyone can access it. This makes
						the GameState to one of the most centered classes for Multiplayer Games.
						While the GameMode would tell how much kills are needed to win, the GameState would
						keep track of the current amount of kills of each Player and/or Team!
						What information you store here is completely up to you.
						It could be an array of scores or an array of a custom struct
						that you use to keep track of groups and guilds.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2> Pawn </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						The class APawn is the 'Actor' that the Player actually controls. Most of the
						time it's a human character, but it could also be a cat, plane, ship, block, etc.
						The Player can only possess one Pawn at a time, but can easily switch
						between Pawns by un-possessing and re-possessing them.
						The Pawn is mostly replicated to all Clients.
						The Pawn's child class ACharacter is often used, because it comes with an already
						networked MovementComponent, which handles replicating the Position, Rotation, etc.
						of a Players Character.

						<h2> PlayerController </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						The class APlayerController might be the most interesting and complicated
						Class that we come across. It's also the center for a lot of Client stuff, since this
						is the first Class that the Client actually 'owns'.
						The PlayerController can be seen as the 'Input' of the Player. It is the link of the
						Player with the Server. This means, every Client has one PlayerController.
						A Client's PlayerController only exists on himself AND the Server, but other
						Clients don't know about other PlayerController.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>HUD</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						The class AHUD is a Class that is only available on each Client and
						can be accessed through the PlayerController. It will be automatically spawned.
						Before UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) has been released, the HUD Class has been used
						to draw text, textures and more in the viewport of the Client.
						By now, Widgets replaced the HUD Class most of the time.
						You can still use the HUD Class to debug or maybe have an isolated area to
						manage spawning, showing, hiding and destroying Widgets.
						Since the HUD isn't directly linked to Networking, examples would only show Singleplayer stuff.
						That's why I will skip them.
